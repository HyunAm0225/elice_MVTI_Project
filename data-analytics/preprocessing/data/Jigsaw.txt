(on tape) Rise and shine, Adam You're probably wondering where you are I'll tell you where you might be You might be in the room that you die in Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives But what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror Now, I see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic But mostly just pathetic So are you going to watch yourself die today, Adam Or do something about it (end) Adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message (on tape) Dr Gordon, this is your wake up call Every day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are going to die soon Now you will be the cause of death Your aim in this game is to kill Adam (Adam glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, then back up at Lawrence) You have until six on the clock to do it There' sa man in the room with you When there's that much poison in your blood (another view of the body from Lawrence's POV), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself (Jigsaw coughs) There are ways to win this hidden all around you Just remember: X marks the spot for the treasure If you do not kill Adam by :, then Alison and Diana will die, Dr Gordon And I'll leave you in this room to rot Let the game begin (end) The looks on each man's face clearly say Oh Shit The tape ends Lawrence stands up (on tape)then Alison and Diana will die, Dr Gordon And I'll leave you in this room to rot (on tape) Let the game begin (on tape) Let the game begin (on tape, in a VERY hushed tone after a brief silence)Follow your heart Lawrence stops the tape (on tape) Hello Paul You are a perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male Yet last month, you ran a straight razor across your wrists Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die, or did you just want some attention Tonight, you'll show me The irony is that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are But if you want to live, you'll have to cut yourself again (Flashback shot of Paul waking up in the cage, looking around, scared and confused The shots go back and forth between the detectives and the Paul flashback, with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire, screaming His screams sound distant under Jigsaw's voice) Find the path through the razor wire to the door But hurry At : that door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul (end) (VO, on tape) Hello Mark If you're so sick, then why do I have so many photos of you up and about (there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of Mark up and about, looking around and getting into a car) Let's put your so-called illness to the test (Flashback image of Mark waking up He is a younger man in his mid to late twenties, with dark brown hair He is completely nude, smeared in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment In front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some chains On the plate is a micro cassette player, a lit votive candle, and a box of matches He gets up, looking around confusedly and scared) Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins The antidote is in the safe (Black and white crime scene shot of the safe, then a shot of Mark standing over it, screaming, his screams distant under Jigsaw's voice, as with Paul) The combination to the safe (quick montage of several black and white crime-scene photos of numbers written all over the walls) is written on the wall Hurry up and program it in But watch your step (Mark's bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor) And by the way, that's a flammable substance smeared on your body (shot of Mark looking at the ointment on his hand, up his arm, everywhere), so I would be careful with that candle, if I were you (VO ct'd)or all the people you've burned with your act (Mark starts to turn the lock on the safe) just might have their revenge We see Mark desperately going around the room, holding the candle, looking at the walls, trying to find a combination The camera goes back and forth a few times in a sped-up shot to him doing this and turning a the lock on the safe, trying to program the combination into the safe He moves in a circle, clockwise to us When he gets to facing right in front of us, the flame from the candle flares up and engulfs the shot, flaring into a close-up crime scene photo of Mark's charred face The shot moves back to the trio of detectives, with Sing holding the tape recorder (from the TV) Hello Amanda You don't know me, but I know you I want to play a game Here's what happens if you lose (The video moves next to the doll, to a device like the one she's wearing attached to a mannequin head As he continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and heavier, and her moans pick up more) The device you're wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open Think of it like a reverse bear trap Here, I'll show you The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device The doll's head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera zooms in on it A timer ticks away A few seconds later, SNAP The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening The video switches back to a close up of the doll (from the TV) There is only one key to open the device It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate Look around, Amanda Know that I'm not lying You better hurry up Live or die Make your choice The video goes to white and gray static, then switches off Amanda begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the chair The camera swings around her, circling, making her movements fast and jerky Amanda manages to pull one arm free, then the other and stands up quickly That's when the cord in the back of the device is pulled out, and the timer starts She freezes, her eyes widening We see a close-up of the timer, and it begins its sixty second countdown She reaches behind her head, pulling at the lock and the timer, trying to pull it off, but it is stuck there She starts freaking out, pulling at it as much as she can, the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her The camera spins back to Amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room, sniffling We see a brief shot of Lawrence, who watches and listens to her with grim amazement Back to Amanda Congratulations You are still alive Most people are so ungrateful to be alive But not you Not anymore Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight spasms She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off Cut to Tapp (VO) X Marks the spot Sometimes you see more with your eyes shut Adam does his best to hide what he has seen, looks up to Lawrence (from the video) Hello Amanda You don't know me, but I know you I want to play a game Here's what happens if you lose There's a timer at the back of the device you're wearing When the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open In the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives talking, then Sing walks in behind Tapp, over to his own desk He turns, watching Tapp watch the screen Tapp stops and rewinds the tape (from video) Think of it like a reverse bear trap Tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play (from video) I'll show you Tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the device going off and exploding Sing watches too, not paying as close attention As soon as it explodes, Sing speaks The look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing concern for his partner's obsession over this case (on video) There is only one key (on video) It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate (on video) It's in the stomach of your dead cellmate Tapp fast forwards (on video) Look around, Amanda Know that I'm not lying (Sing steps off to the right) You better hurry up (Tapp rewinds again, suddenly pauses) Awake already, Jeff I need more powerful tranquilizers next time (Jeff continues his cries, sheds a few tears Jigsaw reaches over and touches his shoulder) Don't cry I've given your life a purpose You're a test subject for something greater than yourself That's when Sing cocks the shotgun and the two detectives move out of their hiding spot, aiming their weapons at Jigsaw Now you'll make a choice (Sing runs up the steps to try to where Jigsaw is, gun aimed at him Tapp remains where he stands) In  seconds, the life of this man will be ended One key will unlock it It's in the box (now facing Tapp, moving closer to him His back is to us, we still don't see his face) Time is running out What's more important to you Officer, arresting me or the life of another human being Sing keeps trying various keys Tapp goes up Jigsaw and grabs him, pushing him down to his knees Jigsaw keeps his arms slightly raised Yes, I am sick, Officer Sick from the disease eating away at me inside Sick of people who don't appreciate their blessings Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others Sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill, breaking and stopping them Tapp glances up at him, briefly distracted by the gunfire (as he pops a blade out of a wristband hidden up his right sleeve) Sick of it all (He lashes upwards, slashing Tapp's throat) (VO) The cigarettes are harmless, I promise Smoking is only poisonous when it ends in bloodshed Think about this - you don't need a gun to kill Adam (VO) Think about thisyou don't need a gun to kill Adam When there's that much poison in your blood (a slow shot moving to the pool of blood from the body in front of Lawrence), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself Lawrence looks at the body, then down He's getting an idea He takes a cigarette, glances over at Adam, who still has his head down in his hands He dips the end of the cigarette in the blood, then puts it back in the box He starts to get up Adam looks up, sees him standing (VO) Hello Mr Hindle Or as they called you around the hospital: (shot of Zep in the hospital with his cleaning cart, stopping at John's room) Zep I want you to make a choice (Shot of the closet doors in Diana's room flying open, Diana screaming, Alison coming in and seeing him looming over her Shot of him tying and gagging Alison and Diana Shot of the photo of Diana and Alison tied and gagged) There's a slow-acting poison coursing through your system (shot of Zep watching the monitor, holding his hand to his mouth He actually looks rather ill) which only I have the antidote for Will you murder and mother and her child (Zep rocking aback and forth, getting ready to kill Alison and Diana) to save yourself (Shot of Zep next to Alison, saying Dr Gordon's time is up; holds the phone to her ear Shot of Zep in the living room, screaming Mrs Gordon Shot of Zep on the floor firing up at Tapp) Listen carefully, if you will There are rules (Lawrence on the floor looking up at Zep, asks Why to which Zep says It's the rules)
