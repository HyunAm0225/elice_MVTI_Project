What’s your name What year are you You know who I am You know what I do Pink (//)                    So you know I’m looking for players Then why did you stop playing Beat Andrew nods, smiles He gets it Summons up all his remaining energy and resumes playing, trying to really show off this time Rolls, fills, speedy stick-work He finishes I asked you why you stopped playing Your version of an answer was to turn into a wind-up drummer monkey Show me your rudiments Andrew nods Plays one rudiment after another: double-stroke roll, paradiddle, ratamacue, flam, flamadiddle Come in, come in, close the door Fletcher rises to greet Andrew, as Andrew closes the door Pink (//)                        Terrific Columbia’s a terrific school Did something precipitate this Bravo (as he starts to head back toward his desk--) Too many students clamp down on their “pursuits” like leeches (sits atop his desk) Hobbies they picked up in their teens, and for what Take a seat What were you then Twelve Oh Well, kids start swimming when they’re six, doesn’t mean they’re Michael Phelps It’s a hobby, never anything you consider going all the way with Am I right Well, kids want anything I wanted to be a nanny Thank God those I trusted talked me out of it Good to listen to advice --good to get outside perspectives So long as they don’t have ulterior motives, I’d listen to what the people you trust tell you Andrew nods But that phrase seems to echo Ulterior motives Fletcher hops down from the desk and makes his way to the couch Ah Well that’s ok You’re young Most people, it takes years for them to find their calling My father, for instance -- he had no idea what he wanted at your age He tried a lot of things, a little bit of this, a little bit of that Took him years before he realized his dream was insurance That was his passion The cubicle, the coffee breaks, the dry wall He lets this simmer for a beat Then-- (turning around to face Andrew) Some, yes But it’s no cakewalk Most kids here can’t last Laszlo Polgar, Hungarian psychologist, declares in  that talent is all about conditioning Says he can make his kids, whoever they are, the best in the world at something What that something is he’ll decide He’s a lousy chess player but he picks chess because it’s objective Goes around looking for a wife, finds one who agrees to his experiment Starts having kids: Susan, Sofia and Judit Gets them practicing before they can even talk These weren’t kids who were sitting and smelling the roses These were kids who were going to leave an actual mark on the world Who was the top female player by  Susan Who played the eight-straight-wins “Miracle of Rome” in  Sofia And who is universally considered the greatest female chess player of all time Judit He takes   a breath Smiles We linger for a second on Andrew, standing   in place, taking it all in Andrew’s eyes quickly drift to   the photos behind Fletcher -- the images on the walls   The Studio Band with Wynton Marsalis Fletcher at the JVC Jazz   Festival One jazz luminary after another Well that’s worrisome I’m sure you had good reason to make your decision No need to do that First instincts are best I’m not sure your first instinct is right, then Why don’t you give it some more thought, and in the meantime (reaches the door; about to close--) make sure your double-time swing is ready by Monday’s Nassau Band He closes the door WE LINGER on Andrew A spark has been lit Down the line Pink (//)                       Instruments SNAP upward with military precision No one wants to miss a beat We’ve got a squeaker today, people Neiman (he pronounces it “Neeman”) Nineteen years old Isn’t he cute Laughs throughout the room We can overhear a few snickers: Alright, gang “Whiplash” Pink (//)                     The players get out the chart Andrew catches a glimpse -- a messy clutter of notes and time signatures Fletcher raises his hand Total silence Then -- the slightest move of Fletcher’s finger, and the band begins WHIPLASH STUDIO BAND REHEARSAL CARL # The chart’s named “Whiplash” for a reason It’s fast, frenetic, / time This fast, with this many polyrhythms, it’s impossibly hard Stop You Barker (pointing to the THIRD TRUMPETER’S horn) That is not your boyfriend’s dick Do not come early Moving ahead Bar  The players flip their sheet music Andrew catches a glimpse of a TROMBONIST ejecting the spit from his horn A puddle has formed by his feet Then why the FUCK didn’t you say so Silence It’s the first time we’ve heard Fletcher really SHOUT His voice is booming, louder than one would have thought Then-- (walking Andrew down the hall) Listen, Andrew I know what you saw in there is worrying you, but there’s a big difference This is your first day Your parents musicians What do they do What’s he written College And your mom So no musicians in the family Well, you’ve just got to listen to the greats then Jo Jones, Buddy Rich You know, Charlie Parker became “Bird” because Jones threw a cymbal at his head Good A beat And, finally-- Yes, you do Were you rushing or were you dragging Start counting In four, damnit Keep counting Was I rushing or I was dragging Start counting again Was I rushing or was I dragging So you do know the difference If you dare to sabotage my band I will fuck you like a pig (flips over a new sheet of music, points to the top) What does this say Count a  Jesus fucking Christ -- I didn’t know they allowed retards into Shaffer Do you expect me to believe you can’t read tempo Can you even read music (points back to the music) What the fuck is this And this Sight-read this measure What are you, in a fucking a capella group Play the goddamn set Andrew plays the measure on the drums Shaking, terrified Pink (//)                  Dear God, is that a tear in your eye Are you one of those single-tear people Do I look like a double fucking rainbow to you Andrew tries to hide his tear, mortified, wipes it, cowers-- Oh so you don’t give a shit about any of this So are you upset Yes or fucking no You are upset Say it so the rest of the band can hear you Louder You are a worthless friendless faggot- lipped little piece of shit, whose Mommy ran out on Daddy once she realized he wasn’t Eugene O’Neill, and who’s now weeping and slobbering over my drum kit like a fifteen-year-old girl -- so for the last father-fucking time, SAY IT LOUDER Carl Carl silently switches places with Andrew at the set Mike (and, to the girl,) I’m so sorry, can I have your autograph (she blushes, shakes her head) Are you playing an instrument yet Ooo, I need pianists (to the girl) What do you say, you ready for Carnegie Hall The Technician smiles again, looks at the girl She hides her face in his chest, embarrassed He and Fletcher laugh (almost matter-of-fact) Get the fuck out of my sight before I demolish you The STAGE HAND nods, slinks away Fletcher addresses his band-- Get it together, Tanner, I swear to God Heads back to his position, glaring at Carl Pissed at Andrew, Carl plays The music BUILDS and we’re-- Now is not the time Neiman lost it The folder is YOUR fucking responsibility, Tanner You should have known not to give Neiman your folder You give a retard a calculator and he’ll try to turn his TV on with it Now get your ass on-stage before I-- Can’t what Come again, darling Visual cues A medical condition What are you, Sanjay Gupta Play the fucking music You know “Whiplash” by heart You’d better pray your memory doesn’t fail you, Neiman And I hope you’ve improved since last month’s rehearsal I am not about to start losing now Then, to the rest of the band-- I’msupposed to say a few words but it’s these kids who should be speaking (turning to his band, earnestly) You earned this, gang (beat, turns to the audience) You know When I was a kid, I saw God Or as some people know him, Charlie Parker My dad snuck me out of school so we could make the drive into Chicago It was a bar so he had to sneak me in, hidden under his coat I didn’t know where in the hell I was I was all of seven But then, by the time I was on my third Shirley Temple, this nice- looking man went up on-stage and started playing And I’ve never been the same since “Cherokee” (looks at Carl) What are you doing No answer Carl, seated at the set, is visibly confused Alright, gang Pick up the new chart by the door Rehearsal tonight starts at  You have ‘til then to learn it PLAYERS head out Andrew grabs his copy of the chart -- it’s called “CARAVAN” -- when-- That’s a double-time swing That’s what got you in here, isn’t it Now, just as was the case with you, I stumbled on a kid practicing his double- time swing the other night I’d like to give him a shot Before Andrew can register, let alone ask “Who”-- Perfect timing Join us, Connolly (Ryan heads over, smiling) You two know each other, don’t you Now, Connolly, I’ve made Andrew a temporary core-- (Andrew’s eyes shoot up at the word “temporary”) --but we’ve got the competition this weekend and I want to make sure the new chart’s in good shape Ryan nods, reaches into his backpack And, to Andrew’s shock, pulls out the “new chart” CARAVAN (as though he can read his mind) I gave it to him this morning, Neiman Now, all I want to do is test out the part Neiman, if you wouldn’t mind, could we take it from the top with just you Andrew tries to keep calm Goes to the drums, lays out the chart Let’s see if Connolly can do it, ok Beat Andrew looks at Ryan Heart pounding, he switches with him Fletcher CLAPS Ryan BEGINS And he plays perfectly Connolly, the chart’s yours See you both tonight at  (answering the phone) Hi, this is Terence He heads to his OFFICE Andrew is still What just happened I said NOT NOW There’s more desperation in Fletcher’s voice than anger And Andrew notices something else: Fletcher’s eyes are watering Andrew is silent He’s never seen Fletcher like this Pink (//)                     Ok Um For the first time ever, he seems uneasy, unsure what to say But Iif you could justput your instruments down Just for a second He turns to the CD player Turns it on A big-band ballad swells A muted trumpet takes the lead It’s CASEY’S SONG, and it’s a tender sound, full of melancholy For a few seconds, Fletcher doesn’t say a word His thoughts seem to be drifting Then, hesitant, as the music plays --that the fastest you can go It is no fucking wonder Mommy ran out on you, you worthless acne-scarred fetal-position Hymie fuck GET OFF Andrew -- whole body shaking, had been playing for half an hour straight -- gets off the kit, struggling for breath, hands coated with torn blisters and blood Fletcher’s rage is unlike anything we’ve seen from him: pained, vengeful Carl gets on the kit Fletcher CLAPS The clock: : Switch Carl stops playing Almost falls as he gets off the kit Ryan takes his place -- just as worn out As soon as he sits down at the set he has to bend down to catch his breath Let’s see if we can finally bring this home He CLAPS Andrew begins pm call tomorrow Leave at least two hours from New York this time Save your travel receipts Or don’t, I don’t give a fuck He then walks off Andrew watches him leave And, as we zero in on Andrew’s eyes we see that something fundamental has changed He looks like a completely different person now % hollowed out Glad you could work us into your schedule, darling Too late Connolly’s playing Andrew looks over to his left -- to Ryan Come again Actually it’s my part I decide who I lend it to I see the folder for a change, but I don’t see the sticks Andrew is about to counter -- when he looks down Looks back Thinks Realizes Skin paling, his heart racing Nope I’m warming the band up now You lost the part, Neiman Pink (//)                   Earned You’ve never earned a thing The only reason you’re a fucking core is because you misplaced a folder The only reason you’re in Studio Band is because I told you what I’d be asking for in Nassau You realize I can cut you anytime I feel Try me you weasel At :, that’s in eleven minutes, my band is on-stage You’re not there with your own sticks, or you show up and make a single mistake -- a single one -- and I’ll send you back to Nassau Band to turn pages until you graduate or drop out For extra kicks, I’ll spread the word on just how you became a Studio Band core, and by the time my sewing circle is done you’ll make your dad look like a success story (lets that linger, then,) Or I can give “Johnny Utah” the part and we’ll leave it at that Your choice Pink (//)                       Beat Andrew catches sight of Carl, standing in the back, watching -- and almost smiling He turns back to Fletcher-- That’s  minutes  seconds left, you pathetic pansy-ass fruit-fuck Andrew turns Bumps into Ryan, PUSHES him out of the way, RUNS The fuck are you doing Andrew keeps playing But the PAIN is harder and harder to ignore His snare drum completely smeared in red now, his stick stained, his whole arm shaking And that RINGING -- just growing and growing, drowning out everything else He looks at the SHEET MUSIC, suddenly lost The horns blast out a hit -- but Andrew isn’t on it Fuck Launches into another fill -- and hits the crash at the wrong time Fletcher stares at him The look says it all: it’s over But Andrew keeps fighting Another missed hit, then a missed time- signature change, the beat falling apart beneath his feet Total chaos, and then, finally, the sign of death -- Andrew STOPS Pink (//)                     Almost immediately, the rest of the band grinds to a halt It’s a horrible sound, like a car screeching, nails on a chalkboard Fletcher stands in place, eyes on Andrew In fact, all eyes are on Andrew The theater is dead-silent Disbelief everywhere Calmly, Fletcher approaches Andrew and whispers one last thing: Neiman Andrew stops Turns Fletcher is standing right there A moment of silence Andrew is pale But Fletcher’s face is a blank So what are you up to these days, Andrew You shouldn’t be A player’s got to be willing to fight Andrew looks at him Good thing you’re not in that place anymore A beat Then -- Fletcher seems distracted By people CLAPPING ALONG to the band No, not exactly He looks at Andrew A moment of tension Does he know Pink (//)                   No, it’s ok -- I know I’ve made some enemies Maybe I seem to think my style is normal, but believe me, I don’t A moment Fletcher finally takes a sip of his drink (shrugs) It’s ok Then, looking off for a moment-- Exactly Young kid, pretty good on the sax, goes up to play his solo in a cutting session, fucks up -- and Jones comes this close to slicing his head off for it He’s laughed off-stage Cries himself to sleep that night But the next morning, what does he do He practices And practices and practices With one goal in mind: that he never ever be laughed off-stage again A year later he goes back to the Reno, and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world had ever heard Andrew smiles Nods Finally -- unlike his uncles, his cousins, even his father -- someone who gets it No Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged Andrew takes this in A moment Not really Here and there The playing never interested me I never wanted to be Charlie Parker I wanted to be the man who made Charlie Parker The man who discovered some scrawny kid, pushed him, prodded him, shaped him into something great -- and then said to the world, “Check this out The best motherfucking solo you’ve ever heard” Sean Sean was a sweet kid And with all those idiots saying “This isn’t for you”, Sean did something great Very few people ever get that chance He pauses Looks off Looks at the musicians on-stage Look I don’t know how you’ll take this That band I’m leading for JVC -- our drummer isn’t cutting it (Andrew looks at him blankly) Do you understand I’m using the Studio Band playlist “Whiplash”, “Caravan” I need a replacement who already knows those charts inside out Andrew looks at him You can’t be serious What about him All he was was your incentive He switched to pre-med (and with a hint of a smile) I think he got discouraged Andrew is speechless now Is this really happening Rest up, gang Call-time Sunday is  (and, as he heads off,) Andrew (Andrew turns) Good job Andrew takes this in The latest in a long line of surprises The PLAYERS pack up Andrew, trying to work past his shyness-- Alright, gang, listen up  seconds to get into places For those of you who are new to this, it’s very simple: do well tonight, and the world will open up for you The folks out there, they make a phone call and you’re a Lincoln Center core Or a Blue Note signee Or an EMC client Drop the ball, and I’d suggest switching careers -- because the other thing about those cats is they never forget Andrew takes this in Beat A STAGE HAND appears, waves Time It was you The lights shift Blue to bright, harsh, near-blinding yellow It’s showtime Andrew is completely still (then, leaning in even closer,) Why do you think I invited you here I’ve known it was you all along Beat He lets it sink in Retreats to his spot, smiling at Andrew Then, off Andrew’s paralyzed stare, he turns to the audience They APPLAUD A few seconds latersilence Then-- I guess you don’t have it Andrew is still in his seat Tears stinging his cheeks (to the audience) Thank you For our final number we’re bringing it back to Ellington This is “Caravan” But then, before Fletcher can even turn back around -- let alone cue the band -- Andrew launches into a double-time Latin Alone, his stick beating away at the ride cymbal, setting the tempo for the rest of the band Everyone looks at him What the fuck He has started on his own, before any cue, beating the drums as though vengefully Fletcher glares at him Who the fuck do you think you are But Andrew just keeps playing Knows exactly what he’s doing and is not about to be stopped Building in his eyes -- that same coiled rage To the BASSIST-- I will gouge out your eyes you motherfucker --but Andrew promptly DROWNS HIM OUT with a crash cymbal hit Another “fuck you” Fletcher’s words only seem to strengthen him The band roars into overdrive, the brass blasting away, Andrew giving everything he’s got Fletcher steps back Andrew just keeps looking straight ahead at him Unafraid now A machine SOLOS begin TROMBONE is up first WE MOVE IN CLOSE to Andrew He looks at his right arm It’s still going He himself seems surprised He takes a chance -- plays a tricky fill Nails it Goes again -- the off-beat hi-hat accent that tripped him up in his first Studio Band rehearsal Nails it The audience is silent No murmurs this time Back to Andrew WE DRIFT DOWN TO HIS FEET His right foot feathering the bass drum so fast all we can see is a blur WE DRIFT BACK UP His left hand Notes popping on the snare, the toms Both his arms battered but utterly determined, as though with minds of their own He breathes, breathes, beating against his fears, his doubts He’s in control, pouring himself into his drums -- and it’s a sight to behold Like a master dancer, movements so fast yet precise, brash yet elegant Violent, frenetic playing, but there’s something gorgeous about it WE DRIFT TO FLETCHER Still glaring at Andrew -- but his face now says one thing and one thing only: This is playing he has never seen before Pink (//)                     The brass starts giving way to drum breaks And Andrew makes of each break a stunner His double-stroke rolls rip- roaring across the toms, his feet and legs switching rhythms, meters, tempos, then careening back into place All limbs moving in a sustained frenzy, sweat splashing, mouth open, eyes blazing, the whole set vibrating, then shaking, looks like it’s about to explode Fletcher turns an inch toward the AUDIENCE Sees them transfixed Take it back to the snare Andrew considers this It’s a good idea He moves back to the snare
