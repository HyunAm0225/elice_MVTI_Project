I believe that what doesn't kill you Bozo PULLS off his MASK The Bank Manager GASPS In the reflections of the glass DEBRIS behind the Bank Manager we see GLIMPSES of a SCARRED MOUTH and CLOWN MAKEUP THE JOKER simply makes you stranger The Bank Manager's eyes go wide The Joker rises, strolls towards the bus, the purple thread attached to the grenade pin UNRAVELLING FROM THE PURPLE LINING of his jacket as he walks The Joker climbs into the bus, SHUTS the rear door, I thought I told bad jokes How about a magic trick The Joker SLAMS the pencil into the table, leaving it A year ago these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you What happened Did your balls drop off See, a guy like me- A guy like me I know why you're holding your little group therapy session in broad daylight I know why you're afraid to go out at night Batman He's shown Gotham your true colors And Dent's just the beginning (indicates Lau) And as for his so-called plan- Batman has no jurisdiction He'll find him and make him squeal (smiles at Lau) I can tell the squealers every time It's simple Kill the Batman Jeers    Laughter Like my mother used to tell me- if you're good at something, never do it for free Half Laughter   The Joker shrugs     Rises Let's not blow this out of all proportion Gambol stares at the Joker     Hard Let me know when you change your minds The Joker strolls out   Maroni turns to Lau How about alive The Joker gets a switchblade in Gambol's mouth- SHARP METAL PULLING THE CHEEK TAUT The Bounty Hunters subdue the remaining bodyguards Wanna know how I got these scars My father was a drinker and a fiend He'd beat mommy right in front of me One night he goes off crazier than usual, mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself He doesn't like that Not One Bit The Joker TUGS Gambols cheek with the blade  So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it Turns to me and says 'why so serious' Comes at me with the knife- 'why so serious' Sticks the blade in my mouth- 'Let's put a smile on that face' and The Joker looks up at the ASHEN FACES of the remaining Body Guards Smiles Why so serious The Joker FLICKS his wrist- the Body Guards flinch as Gambol goes down The Joker turns to them Now, our organization is small, but we've got a lot of potential for aggressive expansion so which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team The three bodyguards all nod   The Joker SNAPS a pool cue Only one slot open right now- so we're going to have try-outs The Joker drops the broken cue in the middle of the men Make it fast The men stare at each other    Then at the jagged pool cue This is how crazy Batman's made Gotham You want order in Gotham Batman has to go So (leans in) Batman must take off his mask, and turn himself in Good evening We're the entertainment I only have one question: where is Harvey Dent (silence) I'll settle for his loved ones A distinguished Gentleman steps into the Joker's path You know, you remind me of my father (GRABS him) I hated my father The Joker has his blade in the Gentleman's mouth Hello, beautiful You must be Harvey's squeeze (runs his knife across her cheek) And you are beautiful You look nervous- it's the scars isn't it Wanna know how I got them I had a wife, beautiful like you Who tells me I worry too much Who says I need to smile more Who gambles And gets in deep with the sharks One day they carve her face, and we've got no money for surgeries She can't take it (presses knife into her cheek) I just want to see her smile again I just want her to know I don't care about the scars So I put a razor in my mouth and do this to myself And you know what (starts laughing) She can't stand the sight of me (or crying) She leaves See, now I see the funny side Now I'm always smiling  A little fight in you   I like that Sure Just take off your mask and show us all who you are Rachel shakes her head at Batman The Joker raises his shotgun to the side and BLOWS OUT the pane of glass next to him The Joker dangles Rachel out the window (laughs) Very poor choice of words He lets her DROP- Rachel falls onto a SLOPING GLASS ROOF- sliding towards the edge Batman DIVES after her- I'm a man of my word Anyone could be driving that thing- stay on Dent The Joker lines up his RPG and prepares to fire-  Do me up- Turns back- levels his RPG out the window    Aims Whoever he was he ain't now The Joker YANKS his dead driver out of the cab, JUMPS over him to take the wheel and pull back onto the roadway Tee 'em up The Thug GRABS his radio Guess it was him Hit me    Come on Hit me Batman watches as the Joker holds out his arms   Waiting for impact There is no room to go around him Batman LOCKS UP THE BRAKES The Joker watches as Batman DUMPS the bike, rather than smashing into him Batman SLAMS into the wall The Joker's thug reach Batman first He is unconscious The first Thug pulls at the mask An ELECTRIC SHOCK from the bat- suit THROWS him back The Joker LAUGHS Flicks his switchblade Crouches- Just give me a second The gun is COCKED The Joker drops the knife Sits Looks back Behind them is the armored car The man standing over him is the Driver He pulls off his helmet It's JIM GORDON    Back from the dead Evening, Commissioner Of course not (laughs) Me I was right here Who did you leave him with Your people Assuming, of course, that they are your people not Maroni's (off look) Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to know how alone you are Gordon can't help glancing at the mounted CAMERA  Does it make you feel responsible for Harvey Dent's current predicament What time is it Depending on the time, he might be in one spot (smiles) Or several Gordon stands     Moves to the Joker   Undoes his handcuffs The good cop, bad cop routine Gordon pauses, hand on the doorknob Never start with the head victim gets fuzzy Can't feel the next- CRACK   Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker's fingers (calm) See I wanted to see what you'd do     And you didn't disappoint (laughs) You let five people die Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were But I know the truth- there's no going back You've changed things Forever Kill you I don't want to kill you What would I do without you Go back to ripping off Mob dealers No you (points) You Complete Me Don't talk like one of them- you're not, even if you'd like to be To them you're a freak like me they just need you right now He regards Batman with something approaching pity But as soon as they don't, they'll cast you out like a leper The Joker looks into Batman's eyes   Searching Their morals, their code it's a bad joke Dropped at the first sign of trouble They're only as good as the world allows them to be You'll see- I'll show you when the chips are down, these civilized people they'll eat each other (grins) See, I'm not a monster I'm just ahead of the curve Batman GRABS the Joker and pulls him upright  You have these rules   And you think they'll save you Then that's the one you'll have to break To know the truth (smiles) The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules Tonight you're going to break your one rule Batman leans in to the Joker There are just minutes left- so, you'll have to play my little game if you want to save (with relish) one of them For a while I thought you really were Dent, the way you threw yourself after her- Batman DROPS the Joker- RIPS up a bolted-down chair-  Look at you go does Harvey know about you and his- The Joker SMASHES into the wall- SLIDES to the floor   Batman stands over him, a man possessed- Killing is making a choice Batman PUNCHES the Joker across the face   HARD you choose one life over the other Your friend, the district attorney Or his blushing bride-to- be Batman PUNCHES the Joker again   The Joker LAUGHS You have nothing Nothing to threaten me with Nothing to do with all your strength (spits a tooth) But don't worry, I'm going to tell you where they are Both of them, and that's the point- you'll have to choose The Batman stares at the Joker He's at  nd Boulevard And she's on avenue X at Cicero  Batman DROPS him I want my phone call  How many of your friends have I killed You know why I use a knife, Detective Guns are too quick You don't get to savor all the little emotions See, in their last moments, people show you who they really are Stephens tries hard to ignore him     It isn't working So, in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did (smiles) Would you like to know which of them were really cowards  I want my phone call  The Detectives look at each other One of them pulls out his cell phone TOSSES it to the Joker, who begins to dial Hello there In his cell    Terrified   Lau I told you- I'm a man of my word (looks around) Where's the Italian The Chechen shrugs   Pulls out a cigar    Lights it I'm a man of simple tastes      I like gunpowder Dynamite He is SPLASHING gasoline onto the money gasoline The Chechen, FURIOUS, steps forwards The Joker turns JABS his gun in the Chechen's face The Chechen's bodyguards REACT The Joker's men DRAW on them And you know what they have in common They're cheap I am The Joker tosses the cigar at the pile I'm only burning my half  The Chechen watches the money catch fire All you care about is money This city deserves a better class of criminal, and I'm going to give it to them This is my town now Tell your men they work for me The Joker crouches down to the Chechen's dogs    They GROWL Cut him up and offer him to his little Princes Let's show him just how loyal a hungry dog is The Joker's men GRAB the Chechen It's not about money     It's about sending a message The Joker watches the towering FLAMES    Lau screams Everything Burns The Joker pulls out a phone I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey The Joker loosens Dent's restraints When you and Rachel were being abducted I was sitting in Gordon's cage I didn't rig those charges- Do I really look like a guy with a plan, Harvey I don't have a planThe mob has plans, the cops have plans You know what I am, Harvey  Dent's hand is TREMBLING I'm a dog chasing cars I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it I just do things I'm just the wrench in the gears I hate plans Yours, theirs, everyone's Maroni has plans Gordon has plans Schemers trying to control their worlds I'm not a schemer, I show the schemers how pathetic their attempts to control things really are So when I say that you and your girlfriend was nothing personal, you know I'm telling the truth Hands him the pistol   Dent holds it to the Joker's head It's the schemers who put you where you are You were a schemer You had plans Look where it got you I just did what I do best- I took your plan, and I turned it on itself Look what I've done to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets Nobody panics when the expected people get killed Nobody panics when things go according to plan, even if the plan is horrifying If I tell the press that tomorrow a gangbanger will get shot, or a truckload of soldiers will be blown up, nobody panics Because it's all part of the plan But when I say that one little old mayor will die, everybody loses their minds Introduce a little anarchy, you upset the established order and everything becomes chaos I'm an agent of chaos And you know the thing about chaos, Harvey Dent looks into the Joker's eyes       Finding meaning It's fair Dent looks down at the coin in his hands Turns it over, feels it's comforting weight Shows the Joker the good side Now you're talking Dent FLICKS the coin into the air       Catches it   Looks What does it take to make you people want to join in  You failed to kill the lawyer I've got to get you off the bench and into the game So, here it is Come nightfall, this city is mine, and anyone left here plays by my rules If you don't want to be in the game, get out now Bar patrons start moving The Joker reaches for the camera- But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are in for a surprise CUT TO STATIC The bar patrons look around, confused Each of you has a remote to blow up the other boat You came    I'm touched All the old familiar places Batman recoils in pain The Joker BUTTS him- KNEES him- ENERGY explodes from his lean frame- he KICKS the injured Batman back towards the glass If we don't stop fighting, we're going to miss the fireworks Can't rely on anyone these days The Joker ARMS the remote Have to do everything yourself I always have- and it's not always easy Just couldn't let me go, could you I guess this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object You truly are incorruptible, aren't you Batman secures the Joker UPSIDE DOWN   The Joker is LAUGHING You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self- righteousness and I won't kill you because you're too much fun We're going to do this forever Maybe we can share it They'll need to double up, the rate this city's inhabitants are losing their minds Till their spirit breaks completely Until they find out what I did with the best of them Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent, and all the heroic things he's done (indicates ferry) Then those criminals will be straight back onto the streets and Gotham will understand the true nature of heroism (off look) I took Gotham's white knight And I brought him down to my level It wasn't hard- madness is like gravity All it takes is a little push Joker laughs   Batman leaves him to the SWATS
